## Migration/Deprecation Notes
- All legacy user-credits/account actions are archived.
- All new actions are modular, composable, context-injected, and robustly tested.
- Context mocks are now in __mocks__ and all tests pass cleanly.
- No direct use of builder, db, or pubsub remains in any module.
- All business rules and non-obvious logic are documented with # Reason: comments.

## Performance Criteria
- All actions are modular, testable, and standards-compliant
- No file exceeds 500 lines
- All actions are auditable and documented
- All tests pass with mocked context/services
- No direct use of builder, db, or pubsub in modules

## Discovered During Work
- Validation schemas for all transaction mutations have been expanded and are now in use.
- Action audit utility pattern is integrated and matches event-music.
- All business rules and non-obvious logic are now documented with # Reason: comments.
- Integration points with analytics, billing, and other modules are being tracked for coordination.
- Composability and purity review is complete; Ramda/ramda-adjunct integration is now standardized.

## Unresolved Complexities
- Finalize and document migration/deprecation notes for legacy actions.
- Review audit logging granularity and transactional integrity for credit transfers.
- Coordinate cross-module integration (analytics, billing, etc.).
- Performance and scalability review for high-volume credit operations.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Finalize migration/deprecation notes
- [ ] Update or create README for user-credits module
- [ ] Coordinate integration with analytics, billing, and other modules
- [ ] Conduct performance and scalability review
- [ ] Ongoing review of audit utility integration and logging granularity
- [ ] Continue to update documentation as new lessons or patterns emerge
