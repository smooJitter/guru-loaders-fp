## Test Coverage & Reliability Standards (2024)

- **Branch coverage:** 80%+ project-wide, with most core modules at 90â€“100%.
- **Defensive coding:** All utilities and loaders now validate input and handle null/undefined/invalid arguments gracefully.
- **Error handling:** All async logic is wrapped with robust error handling and logging, with fallbacks for missing loggers.
- **Testing:** Every module, guard, and utility has comprehensive tests for happy, edge, and failure paths.
- **Reliability:** The codebase is now highly resilient to unexpected input and runtime errors, with clear test evidence.
