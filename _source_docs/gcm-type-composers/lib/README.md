# gcm-type-composers/lib/

This folder contains adapter-level helpers, utilities, and pure functions shared by all GCM type composers.

- Use for logic that is generic to the GCM type composer layer (e.g., type composer wrappers, error transformers).
- Do not use for domain-specific or business logic (those go in the relevant domain-service or domain-models folders).
