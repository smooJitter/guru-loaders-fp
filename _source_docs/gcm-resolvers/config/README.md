# gcm-resolvers/config/

This folder contains adapter-level constants, enums, and configuration shared by all GCM resolvers.

- Use for values that are generic to the GCM resolver layer (e.g., error codes, adapter feature flags).
- Do not use for domain-specific or business logic (those go in the relevant domain-service or domain-models folders).
