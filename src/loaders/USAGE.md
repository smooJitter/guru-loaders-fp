# Loaders Usage Guide

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the loaders within the project, including setup, configuration, and advanced usage scenarios.

---

## Introduction

The loaders in this project are designed to streamline the process of loading and managing various components such as environment configurations, database connections, models, actions, and more. They provide a modular and efficient way to handle different aspects of the application.

---

## Installation

To get started with the loaders, ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Ensure your environment is set up correctly by configuring the necessary environment variables and config files as described in the `env` loader section.

---

## Basic Usage

### Loading Environment Configurations

To load environment-specific configurations, use the `env` loader:

```js
import { createEnvLoader } from './env-loader';
const envLoader = createEnvLoader();
await envLoader(context);
```

### Setting Up Database Connections

To manage database connections, use the `db` loader:

```js
import { createDbLoader } from './db-loader';
const dbLoader = createDbLoader();
await dbLoader(context);
```

### Registering Models

To load and register data models, use the `models` loader:

```js
import { createModelLoader } from './model-loader';
const modelLoader = createModelLoader();
await modelLoader(context);
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Loader Behavior

Loaders can be customized by modifying their configuration files or by extending their functionality through additional modules. For example, you can add custom validation logic or transformation steps in the loader's source file.

### Integrating with Other Modules

Loaders can be integrated with other parts of the system, such as middleware or plugins, to enhance their functionality. This can be done by importing the necessary modules and composing them with the loaders.

---

## Configuration

Loaders can be configured using environment variables, config files, or runtime parameters. Refer to each loader's section in the `DICTIONARY.md` for specific configuration options.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Missing Environment Variables:** Ensure all required environment variables are set before running the loaders.
- **Database Connection Errors:** Check the database URI and credentials in the `db` loader configuration.

### Debugging Tips

- Use console logs or a debugger to trace the execution flow and identify issues within the loaders.
